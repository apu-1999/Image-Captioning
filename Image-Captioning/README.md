# Image-Captioning-

In this project, we have used Deep Neural Networks for image
caption generation . With an image as the input, the method can output an
English caption describing the content in the image. We analyzed three components
of the method: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) and sentence generation. By replacing the CNN part with three state-ofthe-
art architectures, we used ResNet50. The experiments we did showed that the modified
method can generate captions comparable to the-state-of-the-art methods with less
training memory.
