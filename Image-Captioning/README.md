# Image-Captioning-

In this project, i use deep neural networks for image
caption generation . With an image as the input, the method can output an
English sentence describing the content in the image. I analyze three components
of the method: convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network
(RNN) and sentence generation. By replacing the CNN part with three state-ofthe-
art architectures, i use ResNet50. I also propose a simplified version the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) as
a new recurrent layer . The simplified GRU achieves comparable result when it
is compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) method. But it has few
parameters which saves memory and is faster in training. The experiments show that the modified
method can generate captions comparable to the-state-of-the-art methods with less
training memory
